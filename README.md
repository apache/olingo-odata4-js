## Olingo OData Client for JavaScript
The Olingo OData Client for JavaScript (odatajs) is a library written in JavaScript that enables browser based frontend applications to easily use the OData protocol for communication with application servers.

This library "odatajs-4.0.1.min.js" supports only the OData V4 protocol.

For using the OData protocols V1-V3 please refer to the [datajs library](http://datajs.codeplex.com/)

The odatajs library can be included in any html page with the script tag (for example)
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="./sources/odatajs-4.0.1.min.js"></script>
```
and its features can be used through the `odatajs` namespace (or `window.odatajs`). The odatajs library can be used together with the datajs library which uses the `window.OData` namespace.

For API documentation please see [ODatajs API documentation](http://olingo.apache.org/doc/javascript/apidoc/)

You may also use the documentation and the samples from the [datajs library](http://datajs.codeplex.com/documentation) because the features and API are similar.

## Contribute to Olingo OData Client for JavaScript
If you are interested to contribute to this library please have a look into [Project setup](http://olingo.apache.org/doc/javascript/project-setup.html) and [Build instructions](http://olingo.apache.org/doc/javascript/project-build.html) where you find a manual how you can download the source code and build the odatajs library.

If you intend so please also join the [Olingo developers group](http://olingo.apache.org/support.html) for discussion.
